# Election-Analysis
## Election Audit Overview
* The purpose of this election audit was to write Python code to determine the winner of a local congressional Election in Colorado, and to determine the county with the largest voter turnout.
* The Python code that I wrote found the following results:
1. The total number of votes cast in the election
2. The names of each of the candidates in the race
3. The total number of votes and percentage of the total votes that each candidate received
4. The winner of the election along with winning vote count and percentage
5. The names of the counties where voters cast votes in the election
6. The total number of votes cast in each county
7. The county with the largest number of votes cast

## Election Audit Summary
This script that was written can easily be used in other elections as well with just a few modifications. One example is that this could be used for a national election instead of local.  The script could be modified to display voter turnout in the different states instead of counties.  If this script is used for a larger election with many candidates or many states, it could be modified to only display the top 3-5 candidates or top 3-5 states.
